# Python-Projects
Some small python projects I did for a couple of my classes

Program 1 is an attempt to create topograpgical maps using triangles rendered by a Python turtle.

Program 2 attempts to simulate the spread of covid in a 2D environment where sprites can move through. Sprites have a chance of getting sick and subsequently recovering or dying.

Program 3 simulates fireworks in 3D using OpenGL to render.

Program 4 is an attempt to scan video files for people wandering around. The program uses OpenCV to scan the video frame by frame using a human cascade classifier. It identifies movement in the video by comparing the differences in pixels in the frame. It then applyies the cascade to the areas that are signfied to include movement to search for moving people. This way the program is not doing needless work for a static environment.
