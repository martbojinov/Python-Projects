# Python-Projects
Some small python projects I did for a couple of my classes.

Program 1 is an attempt to create topographical maps using triangles rendered by a Python turtle.

Program 2 simulates the spread of COVID-19 in a 2D environment where sprites can move around. Sprites have a chance of getting sick and subsequently recovering or dying. This project was done during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for fun. This project in no way simulates how COVID actually spreads in real life.

Program 3 simulates fireworks in 3D using OpenGL to render. This was my first exposure to computer graphics and writing my own render code in OpenGL.

Program 4 is an attempt to scan video files for people wandering around. The program uses OpenCV to scan the video frame by frame using a human cascade classifier. It identifies movement in the video by comparing the differences in pixels in the frame. It then applyies the cascade to the areas that are signfied to include movement to search for moving people. This way the program is not doing needless work for a static environment.
